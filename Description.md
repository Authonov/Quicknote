# Quicknote
A simple tool to save your input into a .txt file in the same folder Quicknote is located in.

Features:
-Saves your input text to a .txt
-Clear button which clears the input field.
-Smart renaming system, doesn't ever overwrite an existing file because it checks whether the file already exists, and otherwise renames the file (for example, if Quicknote1.txt exists, it will save as Quicknote2.txt).
-A neat GUI.
